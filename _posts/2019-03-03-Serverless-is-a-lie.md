Went to a DevOps meetup ([Devops Columbia](http://meetu.ps/c/3Nt1V/BVzDM/f)) and listened to a good presentation about what "Serverless Functions" are. Turns out, they still use a server! But, that server isn't sitting there waiting to run code. The code is sitting there waiting to be run. You pay by usage and can set various triggers based on anything from time to file changes to Http messages. It seemed pretty cool. It seemed like I should have wrote my REST API as functions so it would be cheaper.

But then again, I should probably get my API actually working with a Front-End before I go breakin.... err changing things.
