It was fun to make, I used some pre-generate GameObjects from a previous Unity3D tutorial and slapped some new scripts on them. The most challenging part was handling the Upgrades in the game.

Maybe it will be my first Software Dev paycheck? That would be neat and would nicely justify and offset my domain name purchases, haha!

I stopped the React course to start doing Top Coder and probably won't get back to React for a while. Based on a future prospect, I'll be [https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/"](Learning Ruby the Hard Way). Probably not as useful as learning React but we'll see.
