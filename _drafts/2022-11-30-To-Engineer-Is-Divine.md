I'm glad you mentioned this. And I'm glad <redacted> asked about Christian bitoiners. I was an atheist for a number of year after being raised in Catholic school until high-school. Recently, I've come back around to God in the past couple of months. Got the family to church for the first time, etc. All that to say that He's been on my mind of late and I haven't been able to figure out why. Then your message here triggered a thought.

I think it's because I'm able to find peace and actually connect with friends and family more. I've been able to find a relationship with God that I hadn't considered before, or actively dismissed. 

I agree with your sentiment that we can't fix the world and only God can. I think Bitcoin has helped me understand this. Then I try to think why that is. I think it has to do with bitcoin's basis in math. Math/physics are constants in our world and so must be put there by our Creator since all things are based in them, at least to our limited understanding. Bitcoin is based in math. This makes it truth, verifiable truth that works to interconnect anyone willing to learn it. It's is not corrupted by humans, who are constantly tempted.

Then I recall a segment from an interview with Michael Saylor (https://podclips.com/ct/Ssgv33). And the segment boils down to engineering being something that is functional and helps you and your fellow man.  And how there's something beautiful about something well engineered because it helps make lives better. All that to consider that God put Satoshi on this earth to engineer a moral money. And He connected Satoshi with the right people on the right mailing list, at seemingly just the right time to be where we are today. And it's all so beautifully engineered that it can't be something other than that Divine.
