            This is supposed to be my awesome blog/personal site and I have yet to get around to doing anything but write my name in binary. <br>
            Please don't let that deter you from checking out my <a href="https://github.com/garyray-k">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garyraykrause">LinkedIn!</a> <br>
            I'm seeking opportunities in Software Development (including interning for free!) starting August 2019. <br>
            I have two projects I'm currently working on: <br>
            &emsp;<a href="https://github.com/garyray-k/davyCrocket">davyCrocket</a> - a hobby Wi-Fi tracking project in Python <br>
            &emsp;<a href="https://github.com/garyray-k/RadonTestsManager">Radon Test Manager</a> - an app for my sister exploring the use of ASP.NET Core <br>
            &emsp;<a href="https://github.com/garyray-k/v20DiceBot">V20 Dice Bot</a> - a Discord Bot using discord.py(rewrite) to roll dice according to Vampire the Masquerade rule.

        <p>
            I recently was helping someone out in a Slack chat I'm part of (<a href="https://codingblocks.net">CodingBlockPodcast</a>) and while shoowing them my example Terminal ouptut
            they commented on my 'repo' folder being in my Dropbox. After a bit more discussion, they enlightened me. Don't use Dropbox and Git source control 
            or you'll end up saturating your Dropbox with all the various versions and branches of your code. This had never occurred to me so I dove deeper into 
            the question. How do I move from one computer to the next and still keep my changes and such?? Git of course! My initial
            reason to not use solely Git was not commiting nonsense as I move between computers, but my good friend on Slack pointed out 
            I could just branch off 'master' into 'nonsense' and do what I please. Then rebase 'nonsense' into 'master' when I'm done.
            It blew my mind! I understand source control a bit more now and will also be jumping into the CLI for Git more.
