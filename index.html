<h2>A simple blog about technical things.</h2>
<p>I know, underwelming. <br> This is supposed to be my awesome blog/personal site and I have yet to get around to doing anything but write my name in binary. <br>
    Please don't let that deter you from checking out my <a href="https://github.com/garyray-k">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garyraykrause">LinkedIn!</a> <br>
    I'm seeking opportunities in Software Development (including interning for free!) starting August 2019. <br>
    I have two projects I'm currently working on: <br>
    &emsp;<a href="https://github.com/garyray-k/davyCrocket">davyCrocket</a> - a hobby Wi-Fi tracking project in Python <br>
    &emsp;<a href="https://github.com/garyray-k/RadonTestsManager">Radon Test Manager</a> - an app for my sister exploring the use of ASP.NET Core
</p>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub pages.</p>
