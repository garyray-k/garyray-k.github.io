        <h2>MagicMirror and YNAB API</h2>
        <h3>20190325 - 2036EST</h3>
        <p>
            Finally had some time at home today to just tinker. Broke out the <a href="https://www.mimomonitors.com/products/mimo-magic-touch">Magic Touch 10in Touchscreen</a>
            and got it working with a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 3</a>. Luckily, Mimo had an excellent 
            <a href="https://www.mimomonitors.com/pages/using-our-usb-displays-with-the-raspberry-pi-3">guide</a> for setting up their monitors with a RPi3.

            Followed along with this for a bit until I couldn't for the life of me persist the "Coordinate Transformation Matrix" (needed to calibrate the
            touchscreen input appropriately). I could run a command after boot and it worked fine but no persistence. After some Google Fu involving Linux
            exorg and determining Device Vendor, I used <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/58117/determine-xinput-device-manufacturer-and-model">this stackexchange</a> 
            to get the answer I needed.

            Lo-and-behold! The touchscreen settings now persist after reboot.

            The next step was to install MagicMirror on my RPi3. SUPER EASY, since the author put a <a href="https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror#raspberry-pi">RPi3 Section</a>
            in his README.md. Got it installed and running but it only runs on the primary monitor (HDMI output) so I'll have to do some more tinkering later to
            have it auto-boot onto my touchscreen display.

            End goal is to have a Google calendar HUD for the family and use the <a href="https://api.youneedabudget.com/">YNAB API</a> to populate
            some data regarding out family budget at a glance.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Update 20190326 0636EST</b><br>
            Just had to change some things in /etc/X11/xorg.conf - Per the guides above, in the "ServerLayout" for the screens, it had "HDMI" set as Screen 0.
            By telling it to set "UGA" as Screen 0 and setting HDMI as Screen 1, we now have the main task bar on our tiny touchscreen. 
            That got the display to be primary but now the touchscreen calibration is off. We have to adjust the "Coordinate Transformation Matrix" again. <br><br>
            Let's look at that:<br>
            We have a 24in monitor that I've set to have a static (static should make this stick across setups) resolution of 1280x720 and a 10in touchscreen with 1024x600.<br>
            According to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Calibrating_Touchscreen">this helpful wiki entry</a> we need to calculate a matrix of c0 0 c1 0 c2 c3 0 0 1
            using <br><br>
            c0 = touch_area_width / total_width<br>
            c2 = touch_area_height / total_height<br>
            c1 = touch_area_x_offset / total_width<br>
            c3 = touch_area_y_offset / total_height<br>
            <br>
            For my setup:<br>
            c0 = 1024 / 2304 ~= 0.44444<br>
            c2 = 600 / 720 ~= 0.83<br>
            c1 = 1280 / 2304 ~= 0.55555<br>
            c3 = 0 / 720 = 0<br>
            <br>
            This got the calibration we needed. Onto implementing and changing up the MagicMirror itself!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Update 20190327 2042EST</b><br>
            Had to install xscreensaver on the RPi to make it stop blanking itself after 10-15min. That was simple.
            Then, finall got it running! Linked up the family calendar and put nice things to know.<br>

        <h2>Top Coder update and Ruby on Rails</h2>
        <h3>20190324 - 0541EST</h3>
        <p>
            I came in second place for the Top Coder. There were a few bugs... err... features in my game
            that I had a few points deducted for. Still a pretty cool site and I think I'll try for some more challenges in the future.
            I suppose I can call my self a professional developer now. Based solely on the definition of:
            if you get paid to do it, you're a "professional".
        </p>
        <p>
            Also have been diving into "Learn Rails 5.2: Accelerated Web Development with Ruby on Rails".
            So far so good, the MVC pattern that Rails uses is exactly what I learned when digging into the
            ASP.NET Core project/API that I built. Of course, it'll be good to acutally dig into the 'V' part of
            that acronym since I only finished the 'MC' part of my project.
            
            As nice and clean as .NET and C# is, Rails seems so much more friendly with the "rails console".
            So many things you can do from the console that make building out your models a breeze. Maybe I missed
            a tool for .NET that would give me similar functionality, but I enjoy the rails console.
            
            Then there is the easy to read language of Ruby. Since it's all designed to be human readable from a 
            language standpoint, it's easy enough to pick up on what's happening by just reading the code.
            I think I'll recommend this to anyone that's got some programming experience but looking for a new language
            since it's easy to understand but you still need to understand programming concepts for it to make sense.
        </p>
        <p> Haven't forgotten that React course, just putting it on pause for a moment...</p>

        <h2>garykrause.dev and Top Coder</h2>
        <p>
            I bought a few different .dev names in the recent release. Maybe you used one to get to this page? That would be neat! There was a lot of buzz in the different Slack channels
            I'm in about the .dev namespace and I definitely jumped on that bandwagon. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Also just finished my first Top Coder challenge for the Veteran community. It's a <a href="https://github.com/garyray-k/breakoutRemix">Breakout Remix</a>. 
            It was fun to make, I used some pre-generate GameObjects from a previous Unity3D tutorial and slapped some new scripts on them. The most challenging part was handling the Upgrades in the game. 
            There was a lot of state management and manipulation to ensure upgrades weren't all over the place and that the gracefully entered and exited the game when appropriate.
            Maybe it will be my first Software Dev paycheck? That would be neat and would nicely justify and offset my domain name purchases, haha!
        </p>
        <p>
            I stopped the React course to start doing Top Coder and probably won't get back to React for a while. Based on a future prospect, I'll be  
            <a href="https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/">Learning Ruby the Hard Way</a>. Probably not as useful as learning React but we'll see.

        <h2>Let's learn Go... oh wait a React tutorial!</h2>
        <h3>20190307 - 0617EST</h3>
        <p>
            Being sick is usually great, get to stay home from the day job and practice coding... unless you get the flu and your whole body aches. Anyway, I'm alive and well
            and on the tail end of the sickness started up a <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learn-go-3-hours-video"> Go tutorial</a> but promptly go distracted and began browsing the web.
            However, Go seems like it's a nice language to use. I like that they take away all the flame war things about spacing and formatting of the code and just force their will on you.
            I imagine for some, that's a non-starter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Onto React! In my browsing and subsequent <a href="https://cynicaldeveloper.com/podcast/109/">podcast</a>> listening, I came across <a href="https://www.manning.com/livevideo/react-in-motion"> Zac Braddy's</a>
            React in Motion course. And I finally caved, I began learning more about JS front end development. It's going quite nciely, Zac structured the course to start with high level concepts that he (supposedly)
            will dive into deeper later in the course. Either way, I think this should be a good structured way to continue the JS journey I've been refusing to start. Perhaps followed up by a different book
            or course that can further reinforce what I'm learning.

        <h2>Serverless is a lie</h2>
        <h3>20190303 - 1914EST</h3>
        <p>
            Went to a DevOps meetup (<a href="http://meetu.ps/c/3Nt1V/BVzDM/f">Devops Columbia</a>) and listed to a good presentation
            about what "Serverless Functions" are. Turns out, they still use a server! But, that server isn't sitting there waiting to
            run code. The code is sitting there waiting to be run. You pay by usage and can set various triggers based on anything from time to 
            file changes to Http messages. It seemed pretty cool. It seemed like I should have wrote my REST API as functions so it would be cheaper.
            But then again, I should probably get my API actually working with a Front-End before I go breakin.... err changing things.

        <h2>Bogus and Mocking Data</h2>
        <h3>20190220 - 1157EST</h3>
        <p> Today my first child is 10 months old! But you're not here for that. Let's talk Bogus</p>
        <p>
            I was going to manually go in and handjam a bunch of test SQL data for use while testing and demoing. But then I stumbled upon
            Bogus. Which is a lovely C# library for creating all kinds of random data but with intent. For instance, you can have it generate
            Lorem Ipsum sentences or sentence, a username, an email, pick from a list, etc. etc. I'm really happy to have found this.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did have to do some weird stuff in Program.cs because I'm calling two additional functions to populate the data. The 
            intent is to comment out or remove those two lines before sending this thing out into the wild.

        <h2>Blazor, CORS, and JS</h2>
        <h3>20190218 - 1657EST</h3>
        <p>
            I've been stalling a lot in building this front end for the API, but just wanted to muse a bit about what I've learned recently.
            I went through the 'Practical Javascript' @ watchandcode.com and learned a bit about JS. There's a lot more to it though. Really seems daunting
            but I suppose that's because I've never done it.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a long drive home I listened to a .NET Rocks podcast about Blazor and that got me thinking that I could just write the front 
            end using Blazor and skip learning more JS. Not sure if that's the best idea but it's an idea for now. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This all led me to asking around int he Operation Code Slack channle about doing dev on a web-page. One thing led to another 
            and I don't know anything about making a web page. yet. Regardless of that, I did get some clarification on somethign within my API
            that I was clueless on. CORS. I learned that it basically tells a browser when to enable using data from a certain API. So if I
            tell my API to app.UseCors() but .WithOrigins("http://foo.com") then the browser will know to only use my API's data when working with foo.com

        <h2>Git Enlightenment via Slack</h2>
        <h3>20190213 - 0751EST</h3>
        <p>
            I recently was helping someone out in a Slack chat I'm part of (<a href="https://codingblocks.net">CodingBlockPodcast</a>) and while shoowing them my example Terminal ouptut
            they commented on my 'repo' folder being in my Dropbox. After a bit more discussion, they enlightened me. Don't use Dropbox and Git source control 
            or you'll end up saturating your Dropbox with all the various versions and branches of your code. This had never occurred to me so I dove deeper into 
            the question. How do I move from one computer to the next and still keep my changes and such?? Git of course! My initial
            reason to not use solely Git was not commiting nonsense as I move between computers, but my good friend on Slack pointed out 
            I could just branch off 'master' into 'nonsense' and do what I please. Then rebase 'nonsense' into 'master' when I'm done.
            It blew my mind! I understand source control a bit more now and will also be jumping into the CLI for Git more.
