        <h2>Journey So Far</h2>
        <h3>20190415 - 0537</h3>
        <p>
            Just wanted to take second to catalog my developer journey so far. More as a reference for myself in the future than for any curious readers that stumble across my page.
        </p>
        <p>
            It started with Python at the end of 2012. I began learning at the behest of my friend Justin, who told me it would be useful for parsing the massive CSV files we were dealing with.
            I began by browsing some books on Safari Books, and signing up for a Coursera course. It was fun and exciting and I learned some basics while making a game and scripting out
            some workflows, but I didn't take it super serious and all my scripts were one file because getting them to work together was hard. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My dabbling in Python went on for some time before things got serious. I moved to a new job that still dealt with some data management but was much more technical (involving RF,
            Linux, wireless protocols, and a heap of other tech). This technical new job also had me linking up with a lot more technically minded people and attending some pretty awesome
            tech courses. In and out of work, I was tinkering with networks and security which lead me to Kali Linux. Again, I was introduced but didn't take it too serious and I'd still say 
            I'm no pentesting expert, but I got a good taste of exploiting vulnerabilities starting 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
            By 2017, I was finally looking for something serious to work on. I planned my exit from the Navy and on recommendation from a good friend (who's now at Microsoft) I started learning
            C# and the .NET framework. Starting with a few Udemy courses from Mosh Hademi, I began a rigorous study. Around the same time I was afforded the opportunity to get my Security+ certification.
            Mosh's courses were awesome and set a good foundation to branch into other books and online videos. I began doing some Unity3D courses as well, since I do enjoy a good video game now and then.
            While I was downloading Visual Studio and learning C#, my sister asked me to write a simple CRUD app for her to manage an inventory at work. Seemed easy enough, I would just follow along with
            one of the books I find online and adjust it to my needs... Close to 8 months later at this point and I have a backend REST API that kind of does what I want and the beginnings of a frontend
            written in an experimental framework (Blazor). I was able to get it runnning in Docker so that was a win and a learning experience for sure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we come to 2019. I'm on the way out of the Navy and heading into my first real world job this summer. An internship with a cyber security firm that has some dev work and other projects.
            I'm excited to begin since the company seems to have projects relating to everything I'm interested in: Unity3D development, web development, and pentesting. I've also began attending Meetups
            on a regular basis. They're FANTASTIC. Just showing up and listening to other people talk is super helpful for picking up on terms I'm unfamiliar with. I also think community is an important 
            thing to be a part of.

        <h2>Dual-Pivot Quick Sort using Ruby</h2>
        <h3>20190405 - 1546EST</h3>
        <p>
            Algorithms. Something you'd learn during your CS degree, which I don't currently have. Which was a good reason to register for a Top Coder
            challenge creating a dual-pivot quick sort using Ruby. Since I'm also studying Ruby (on Rails), it was a good way to kill two birds with one stone.
            Learn an algorithm and also practice with a new language. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning the algorithm was the hard part. The Challenge Overview was:<br><br>
            <i>The idea of dual pivot quick sort is to take two pivots, one in the left end of the array and the second, in the right end of the array. 
            The left pivot must be less than or equal to the right pivot, so we swap them if necessary. 
            Then, we begin partitioning the array into three parts: in the first part, all elements will be less than the left pivot, in the second 
            part all elements will be greater or equal to the left pivot and also will be less than or equal to the right pivot, and in the third 
            part all elements will be greater than the right pivot. Then, we shift the two pivots to their appropriate positions as we see in the 
            below bar, and after that we begin quicksorting these three parts recursively, using this method.</i><br><br>
            Which sounds easy enough. If you understand Ruby already. My first couple of tries resulted in a final array of arrays.
            Luckily they were all sorted arrays within the array but it still wouldn't work properly. I caved and googled dual-pivot quicksort
            and came across <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dual-pivot-quicksort/">this article</a> which outlined the algorithm but using C.
            After studying that for a bit and learning how variables/parameters were passed in Ruby (reference vs. value), I was able to write a functioning
            sorrting method.
        </p>
        <p>
            I won the challenge and had some good feedback from it. I used my code comments as a document of my own understanding of what was going on
            which resulted in a whole lot of unnecessary comments. Cleaned them up but it'll be good to go back and reference at a later time when I go 
            to study other algorithms. I also got in touch with one of the other entrants via a common Slack channel. After exchanging notes, his implementation was 
            sooooo much cleaner and more "Ruby" than mine. It'll be another thing I reference when I look to write some quality Ruby code in the future.

        <h2>MagicMirror and YNAB API</h2>
        <h3>20190325 - 2036EST</h3>
        <p>
            Finally had some time at home today to just tinker. Broke out the <a href="https://www.mimomonitors.com/products/mimo-magic-touch">Magic Touch 10in Touchscreen</a>
            and got it working with a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 3</a>. Luckily, Mimo had an excellent 
            <a href="https://www.mimomonitors.com/pages/using-our-usb-displays-with-the-raspberry-pi-3">guide</a> for setting up their monitors with a RPi3.

            Followed along with this for a bit until I couldn't for the life of me persist the "Coordinate Transformation Matrix" (needed to calibrate the
            touchscreen input appropriately). I could run a command after boot and it worked fine but no persistence. After some Google Fu involving Linux
            exorg and determining Device Vendor, I used <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/58117/determine-xinput-device-manufacturer-and-model">this stackexchange</a> 
            to get the answer I needed.

            Lo-and-behold! The touchscreen settings now persist after reboot.

            The next step was to install MagicMirror on my RPi3. SUPER EASY, since the author put a <a href="https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror#raspberry-pi">RPi3 Section</a>
            in his README.md. Got it installed and running but it only runs on the primary monitor (HDMI output) so I'll have to do some more tinkering later to
            have it auto-boot onto my touchscreen display.

            End goal is to have a Google calendar HUD for the family and use the <a href="https://api.youneedabudget.com/">YNAB API</a> to populate
            some data regarding out family budget at a glance.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Update 20190326 0636EST</b><br>
            Just had to change some things in /etc/X11/xorg.conf - Per the guides above, in the "ServerLayout" for the screens, it had "HDMI" set as Screen 0.
            By telling it to set "UGA" as Screen 0 and setting HDMI as Screen 1, we now have the main task bar on our tiny touchscreen. 
            That got the display to be primary but now the touchscreen calibration is off. We have to adjust the "Coordinate Transformation Matrix" again. <br><br>
            Let's look at that:<br>
            We have a 24in monitor that I've set to have a static (static should make this stick across setups) resolution of 1280x720 and a 10in touchscreen with 1024x600.<br>
            According to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Calibrating_Touchscreen">this helpful wiki entry</a> we need to calculate a matrix of c0 0 c1 0 c2 c3 0 0 1
            using <br><br>
            c0 = touch_area_width / total_width<br>
            c2 = touch_area_height / total_height<br>
            c1 = touch_area_x_offset / total_width<br>
            c3 = touch_area_y_offset / total_height<br>
            <br>
            For my setup:<br>
            c0 = 1024 / 2304 ~= 0.44444<br>
            c2 = 600 / 720 ~= 0.83<br>
            c1 = 1280 / 2304 ~= 0.55555<br>
            c3 = 0 / 720 = 0<br>
            <br>
            This got the calibration we needed. Onto implementing and changing up the MagicMirror itself!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Update 20190327 2042EST</b><br>
            Had to install xscreensaver on the RPi to make it stop blanking itself after 10-15min. That was simple.
            Then, finally got it running! Linked up the family calendar and put nice things to know.<br>
            <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0s2wf5voaa42cfy/2019-03-27%2021.14.21.jpg?raw=1" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" />

        <h2>Top Coder update and Ruby on Rails</h2>
        <h3>20190324 - 0541EST</h3>
        <p>
            I came in second place for the Top Coder. There were a few bugs... err... features in my game
            that I had a few points deducted for. Still a pretty cool site and I think I'll try for some more challenges in the future.
            I suppose I can call my self a professional developer now. Based solely on the definition of:
            if you get paid to do it, you're a "professional".
        </p>
        <p>
            Also have been diving into "Learn Rails 5.2: Accelerated Web Development with Ruby on Rails".
            So far so good, the MVC pattern that Rails uses is exactly what I learned when digging into the
            ASP.NET Core project/API that I built. Of course, it'll be good to actually dig into the 'V' part of
            that acronym since I only finished the 'MC' part of my project.
            
            As nice and clean as .NET and C# is, Rails seems so much more friendly with the "rails console".
            So many things you can do from the console that make building out your models a breeze. Maybe I missed
            a tool for .NET that would give me similar functionality, but I enjoy the rails console.
            
            Then there is the easy to read language of Ruby. Since it's all designed to be human readable from a 
            language standpoint, it's easy enough to pick up on what's happening by just reading the code.
            I think I'll recommend this to anyone that's got some programming experience but looking for a new language
            since it's easy to understand but you still need to understand programming concepts for it to make sense.

        <p> Haven't forgotten that React course, just putting it on pause for a moment...</p>

        <h2>garykrause.dev and Top Coder</h2>
        <p>
            I bought a few different .dev names in the recent release. Maybe you used one to get to this page? That would be neat! There was a lot of buzz in the different Slack channels
            I'm in about the .dev namespace and I definitely jumped on that bandwagon. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Also just finished my first Top Coder challenge for the Veteran community. It's a <a href="https://github.com/garyray-k/breakoutRemix">Breakout Remix</a>. 
            It was fun to make, I used some pre-generate GameObjects from a previous Unity3D tutorial and slapped some new scripts on them. The most challenging part was handling the Upgrades in the game. 
            There was a lot of state management and manipulation to ensure upgrades weren't all over the place and that the gracefully entered and exited the game when appropriate.
            Maybe it will be my first Software Dev paycheck? That would be neat and would nicely justify and offset my domain name purchases, haha!
        </p>
        <p>
            I stopped the React course to start doing Top Coder and probably won't get back to React for a while. Based on a future prospect, I'll be  
            <a href="https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/">Learning Ruby the Hard Way</a>. Probably not as useful as learning React but we'll see.

        <h2>Let's learn Go... oh wait a React tutorial!</h2>
        <h3>20190307 - 0617EST</h3>
        <p>
            Being sick is usually great, get to stay home from the day job and practice coding... unless you get the flu and your whole body aches. Anyway, I'm alive and well
            and on the tail end of the sickness started up a <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learn-go-3-hours-video"> Go tutorial</a> but promptly go distracted and began browsing the web.
            However, Go seems like it's a nice language to use. I like that they take away all the flame war things about spacing and formatting of the code and just force their will on you.
            I imagine for some, that's a non-starter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Onto React! In my browsing and subsequent <a href="https://cynicaldeveloper.com/podcast/109/">podcast</a>> listening, I came across <a href="https://www.manning.com/livevideo/react-in-motion"> Zac Braddy's</a>
            React in Motion course. And I finally caved, I began learning more about JS front end development. It's going quite nciely, Zac structured the course to start with high level concepts that he (supposedly)
            will dive into deeper later in the course. Either way, I think this should be a good structured way to continue the JS journey I've been refusing to start. Perhaps followed up by a different book
            or course that can further reinforce what I'm learning.

        <h2>Serverless is a lie</h2>
        <h3>20190303 - 1914EST</h3>
        <p>
            Went to a DevOps meetup (<a href="http://meetu.ps/c/3Nt1V/BVzDM/f">Devops Columbia</a>) and listed to a good presentation
            about what "Serverless Functions" are. Turns out, they still use a server! But, that server isn't sitting there waiting to
            run code. The code is sitting there waiting to be run. You pay by usage and can set various triggers based on anything from time to 
            file changes to Http messages. It seemed pretty cool. It seemed like I should have wrote my REST API as functions so it would be cheaper.
            But then again, I should probably get my API actually working with a Front-End before I go breakin.... err changing things.

        <p> Today my first child is 10 months old! But you're not here for that. Let's talk Bogus</p>
        <p>
            I was going to manually go in and hand-jam a bunch of test SQL data for use while testing and demoing. But then I stumbled upon
            Bogus. Which is a lovely C# library for creating all kinds of random data but with intent. For instance, you can have it generate
            Lorem Ipsum sentences or sentence, a username, an email, pick from a list, etc. etc. I'm really happy to have found this.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did have to do some weird stuff in Program.cs because I'm calling two additional functions to populate the data. The 
            intent is to comment out or remove those two lines before sending this thing out into the wild.

        <h2>Blazor, CORS, and JS</h2>
        <h3>20190218 - 1657EST</h3>
        <p>
            I've been stalling a lot in building this front end for the API, but just wanted to muse a bit about what I've learned recently.
            I went through the 'Practical Javascript' @ watchandcode.com and learned a bit about JS. There's a lot more to it though. Really seems daunting
            but I suppose that's because I've never done it.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a long drive home I listened to a .NET Rocks podcast about Blazor and that got me thinking that I could just write the front 
            end using Blazor and skip learning more JS. Not sure if that's the best idea but it's an idea for now. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This all led me to asking around int he Operation Code Slack channle about doing dev on a web-page. One thing led to another 
            and I don't know anything about making a web page. yet. Regardless of that, I did get some clarification on somethign within my API
            that I was clueless on. CORS. I learned that it basically tells a browser when to enable using data from a certain API. So if I
            tell my API to app.UseCors() but .WithOrigins("http://foo.com") then the browser will know to only use my API's data when working with foo.com

        <h2>Git Enlightenment via Slack</h2>
        <h3>20190213 - 0751EST</h3>
        <p>
            I recently was helping someone out in a Slack chat I'm part of (<a href="https://codingblocks.net">CodingBlockPodcast</a>) and while showing them my example Terminal ouptut
            they commented on my 'repo' folder being in my Dropbox. After a bit more discussion, they enlightened me. Don't use Dropbox and Git source control 
            or you'll end up saturating your Dropbox with all the various versions and branches of your code. This had never occurred to me so I dove deeper into 
            the question. How do I move from one computer to the next and still keep my changes and such?? Git of course! My initial
            reason to not use solely Git was not commiting nonsense as I move between computers, but my good friend on Slack pointed out 
            I could just branch off 'master' into 'nonsense' and do what I please. Then rebase 'nonsense' into 'master' when I'm done.
            It blew my mind! I understand source control a bit more now and will also be jumping into the CLI for Git more.
