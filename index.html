        <h2>Bogus and Mocking Data</h2>
        <h3>20190220 - 1157EST</h3>
        <p> Today my first child is 10 months old! But you're not here for that. Let's talk Bogus</p>
        <p>
            I was going to manually go in and handjam a bunch of test SQL data for use while testing and demoing. But then I stumbled upon
            Bogus. Which is a lovely C# library for creating all kinds of random data but with intent. For instance, you can have it generate
            Lorem Ipsum sentences or sentence, a username, an email, pick from a list, etc. etc. I'm really happy to have found this.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did have to do some weird stuff in Program.cs because I'm calling two additional functions to populate the data. The 
            intent is to comment out or remove those two lines before sending this thing out into the wild.

        <h2>Blazor, CORS, and JS</h2>
        <h3>20190218 - 1657EST</h3>
        <p>
            I've been stalling a lot in building this front end for the API, but just wanted to muse a bit about what I've learned recently.
            I went through the 'Practical Javascript' @ watchandcode.com and learned a bit about JS. There's a lot more to it though. Really seems daunting
            but I suppose that's because I've never done it.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a long drive home I listened to a .NET Rocks podcast about Blazor and that got me thinking that I could just write the front 
            end using Blazor and skip learning more JS. Not sure if that's the best idea but it's an idea for now. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This all led me to asking around int he Operation Code Slack channle about doing dev on a web-page. One thing led to another 
            and I don't know anything about making a web page. yet. Regardless of that, I did get some clarification on somethign within my API
            that I was clueless on. CORS. I learned that it basically tells a browser when to enable using data from a certain API. So if I
            tell my API to app.UseCors() but .WithOrigins("http://foo.com") then the browser will know to only use my API's data when working with foo.com

        <h2>Git Enlightenment via Slack</h2>
        <h3>20190213 - 0751EST</h3>
        <p>
            I recently was helping someone out in a Slack chat I'm part of (<a href="https://codingblocks.net">CodingBlockPodcast</a>) and while shoowing them my example Terminal ouptut
            they commented on my 'repo' folder being in my Dropbox. After a bit more discussion, they enlightened me. Don't use Dropbox and Git source control 
            or you'll end up saturating your Dropbox with all the various versions and branches of your code. This had never occurred to me so I dove deeper into 
            the question. How do I move from one computer to the next and still keep my changes and such?? Git of course! My initial
            reason to not use solely Git was not commiting nonsense as I move between computers, but my good friend on Slack pointed out 
            I could just branch off 'master' into 'nonsense' and do what I please. Then rebase 'nonsense' into 'master' when I'm done.
            It blew my mind! I understand source control a bit more now and will also be jumping into the CLI for Git more.
